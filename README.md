# To-Do-List-App
Simple To-Do List App created with React Native inspired by an Online Tutorial by "Made With Matt". 

This is a test project with minimal functionality which includes Adding & Deleting Tasks.
- In the current state the app is not complete. Future updates will be coming to customize the app for my needs.
- The app is not in an executable version, you need to have Node.js to test the application and use command `npx expo start` in a terminal to initialize it.
